# Integrated genomic and epigenomic analysis reveals distinct molecular subtypes in congenital heart disease and neurodevelopmental disorders

## Overview

This repository contains the computational analysis code for our multi-omic study investigating the genetic and epigenetic factors contributing to the co-occurrence of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) and congenital heart disease (CHD).

## Study Design

- **Cohort**: 14 trios and 1 duo (probands with NDD and/or CHD plus biological parents)
- **Data types**: 
  - Whole genome sequencing (WGS)
  - RNA sequencing (subset of 10 trios)
  - DNA methylation arrays (all 15 families)
- **Key findings**:
  - 64% diagnostic yield from genetic variants
  - Dramatic epigenetic age acceleration in CHD patients (~17 years)
  - Extreme methylation dysregulation in specific patients
